## Code Baker IEEE — AI Materials (Preprocessing & Supervised Learning)

A lightweight collection of Jupyter notebooks covering essential AI/ML topics:

- **Preprocessing**: data cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, and encoding
- **Supervised Learning**: classification and regression examples

This repository is for **educational purposes**. It is a **work in progress** and will be **updated soon**.

### What’s inside
- `Preprocessing/`: notebooks for dataset preparation workflows
- `ML_Classification/`: supervised classification examples
- `ML_Regression/`: supervised regression examples

### Getting started
- Open the notebooks (`.ipynb`) with Jupyter Notebook/Lab or VS Code and run cells sequentially.
- Use your preferred Python environment; package versions are intentionally flexible for learning.

### Status
Not finished yet. Content will be expanded and refined over time.
